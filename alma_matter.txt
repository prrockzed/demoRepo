I am studying in IIT Kharagpur.
It is the largest institute in India with an area of more than 2150 acres.
It is one of the top 5 engineering institutes of the country.
It is an institute of eminence.
You will get to study and interact with the best minds of the country.
Though having an academic load, the campus life is awesome and uncomparable with any institute.
